PygLatin
========
This script is based on the PygLatin Python exercise written by Kate Lockwood:
* If a word begins with a vowel, "ay" is appended to the end of the word.
* If a word instead begins with a consonant, the first letter of the word is moved to the end, and the result is appended with "ay".

Usage:
======
/pyg &lt;message&gt;

Notes:
======
This script does not currently handle words containing numbers or punctuation.
