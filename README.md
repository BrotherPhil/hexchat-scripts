### hexchat-scripts
Most of these scripts are experimental or works in progress. See below for scripts you should use instead.

### Installation:
Place "script.py" in your HexChat addons folder. The HexChat Python plugin interface is required.

### Notes:
All scripts are under the [MIT license] (./license) unless otherwise stated.

I highly recommend checking out [Farow's readme] (https://github.com/Farow/hexchat-scripts). In addition to his scripts, I use many of the ones that he has linked to. Also check out my starred repositories to find good scripts that aren't linked to in that readme.
