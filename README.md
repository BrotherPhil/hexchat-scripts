---------------
Some of these scripts are still a work in progress. Please let me know if you find any issues.

Installation:
-------------
Place "script.py" in your HexChat addons folder:

* Windows:
    * `%APPDATA%/HexChat/addons`
* Linux:
    * `~/.config/hexchat/addons`

The HexChat Python plugin interface is required.

Notes:
------
All scripts are under the [MIT license] (./license) unless otherwise stated.

I highly recommend checking out [Farow's readme] (https://github.com/Farow/hexchat-scripts). In addition to his scripts, I use many from all of the repositories that he has linked to, especially [TingPing's] (https://github.com/TingPing/plugins). Also check out my starred repositories to find additional scripts that I might have not yet listed below.

Here are some links in addition to Farow's:
