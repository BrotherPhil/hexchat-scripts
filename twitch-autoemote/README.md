twitch-autoemote
================
Automatically formats twitch.tv emotes with proper capitalization

Usage:
======
Emotes are automatically formatted only for text sent to channels on twitch.

Example: "Hello kappa frankerz" is automatically converted to "Hello Kappa FrankerZ" after you send your message.

Notes:
======
I have combined this script with my [forked version] (https://github.com/PoorDog/plugins/blob/master/HexChat/twitch.py) of [TingPing's twitch.py] (https://github.com/TingPing/plugins/blob/master/HexChat/twitch.py) script. Use that script instead if you want a more comprehensive twitch experience.

Thanks to [TingPing] (https://github.com/TingPing) and [GermainZ] (https://github.com/GermainZ) for help with some syntax and implementation.
