RequestFilter
-------------
Move search requests (@find, @search, @seek, etc.) and fserve file requests to a separate tab

Usage:
------
You only need to modify `channels = []` for this script to work. See the script comment if you need instructions on how to add a channel to the filter list.

Notes:
------
To those coming from mIRC, this is meant to to partially replicate the request-related functionality of [DukeLupus's dlFilter script] (http://dukelupus.com/dlfilter).

This script is meant to complement [adfilter.py] (https://github.com/PoorDog/hexchat-scripts/tree/master/adfilter), but they can be used independently of each other.
