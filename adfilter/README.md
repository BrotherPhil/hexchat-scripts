You only need to modify `channels = []` for this script to work. See the script comment if you need instructions on how to add a channel to the filter list.

Notes:

To those coming from mIRC, this is meant to to partially replicate the ad-related functionality of [DukeLupus's dlFilter script] (http://dukelupus.com/dlfilter).
