AdFilter
--------
Move common fserve advertisements to a separate tab

Usage:
------
You only need to modify `channels = []` for this script to work. See the script comment if you need instructions on how to add a channel to the filter list.

Notes:
------
To those coming from mIRC, this is meant to to partially replicate the ad-related functionality of [DukeLupus's dlFilter script] (http://dukelupus.com/dlfilter).

The current filters only include ads that I have encountered thus far.
If you find an ad that you would like me to add to the list, please let me know and send me the entire content of the ad,
preferably with all color and attribute formatting stripped from it.

TODO: Add filter for fserve.pl (irssi), add filter for ObsidianÂ², add filter for Iterati Solutions fserve, filters for various unknown fserves, improve regexes
